The problem to solve is the synchronization of two file system directories. 
Supposing the original structure were: 

<tree name="root">
    <tree name="home">
    <tree name="joe">
        <file name="a.txt" modif-date="20120102T1030" size="5032"/>
    </tree>
    </tree>
</tree>
 

(which comes down to having one file /home/joe/a.txt). Now, if the
modified structure were something like:

<tree name="root">
    <tree name="home">
    <tree name="joe">
        <file name="a.txt" modif-date="20120102T1030" size="5032"/>
        <file name="b.txt" modif-date="20120102T1030" size="1234"/>
    </tree>
    </tree>
</tree>


the diff between the two would be the new file /home/joe/b.txt.

If preferred, one can use actual filesystem directories as input instead
of XML. The action to be take is to create the /home/joe/b.txt using a
possibly mock implementation of the following Java interface :
https://github.com/dtrott/fuse4j/blob/master/maven/fuse4j-core/src/main/java/fuse/Filesystem3.java.

 
The goal of the exercise is to write a program in the Java language that
is able to detect diffs between such XML descriptions for a number of
common cases:

* file update
* new file
* new directory
* file rename
* ...

Is appreciated the capacity to create smart working software, to create
explicit technical specifications from generic requirements and proper
testing. 

The provided tests will be automatically reproductible, prove the
correct working of the code and will be illustrative of the usage of the
software. The provided package should respect the standard Java layout
and have a command-line automatic build which can build the sources and
run tests.
